10.1 Managing Inventory

Understanding Inventory Options:
* A static inventory file can be used as a list of managed hosts
* Dynamic inventory can automatically discover hosts, by talking to an external host management system, such as FreeIPA, Active Directory, 
  Red Hat Satelite and more
* Also, multiple inventories can be used, for instance by putting multiple inventory files in a directory and use that as the source 
  of inventory

Managing Dynamic Inventory:
* Dynamic inventory scripts are avaliable for different environments
	* Check https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/contrib/inventory
* They are used like static inventory files, through ansible.cfg, or using the -i option to the ansible[-playbook] command
* Instead of using community dynamic inventory scripts, you can also write your own

Writing Dynamic Inventory Scripts:
* The only requirement is that the script returns the inventory information in JSON format 
* To see the correct output format, use ansible-inventory --list on any inventory
* Scripts can be written in any language, but Python is common

Using Multiple Inventory Files:
* If the inventory specified is a directory, all inventory files in that directory are considered
* This includes as well as dynamic inventory
* Inventory files cannot be created with dependencies to other inventory files


ansible-inventory --list
vim pascal.py
./pascal.py --list

10.2 Addressing Host Patterns 

Addressing Hosts:
* By default, hosts are addressed with their host name as specified in inventory
* IP addresses can also be used
* Host groups are common and are defined in inventory:
	* Group: all is implicit and doesn't have to be defined
	* Group: ungrouped is also implicit and addresses all hosts that are not members of a group
* If special characters are used, always put them between quotes to avoid the special character being interpreted by the shell

Addressing Hosts Wildcard Examples:
* -hosts: '*.example.com'
* -hosts: '192.168.*'
* -hosts: 'web*'
* -hosts: web1,db1,192.168.4.2
* -hosts: web,&eastcoast
* -hosts: web,!web1
* -hosts: all,!web

10.3 Configuring Parallelism

Understanding Processing Order:
* Plays are executed in order on all hosts referred to, and normally Ansible will start the next task if this task successfully completed on all managed hosts
* Ansible can run on multiple managed hosts simultaneously, but by default the maximum number of simultaneous hosts is limited to five 
* Set forks=n in ansible.cfg to change the maximum number of simultaneous hosts
* Alternatively, use -f nn to specify the max number of forks as argument to the ansible[-playbook] command
* The dafault of 5 is very limited, so you can set this parameter much higher, in particular if most of the work is done on the managed hosts and not on the control mode

Managing Rolling Updates:
* The dafault behaviour of running one task on all hosts, and next proceed to the next task means that in cluster environments you may have all hosts temporarily being unavaliable
* Use the serial keyword in the playbook to run hosts through the entire play in batches

10.4 Organizing Directory Structure

Understanding Inclusion:
* If playbooks grow larger, it is common to use modularity by using includes and imports
* Includes and imports can happen for playbooks as well as tasks 
* An include is a dynamic process; Ansible processes the contents of the included files at the moment that this import is reached 
* An import is a static process; Ansible preprocesses the imported file contents before teh actual play is started
	* Playbook imports must be defined at the beginning of the playbook, using: import_playbook
	
Including Tasks Files:
* A task file is a flat list of tasks
* Use: import_tasks to statically import a task file in the playbook, it will be included at the location where it is imported
* Use: include_tasks to dynamically include a task file
* Dynamically including tasks means that some features are not avaliable:
	* ansible-playbook --list-tasks will not show teh tasks
	* ansible-playbook --start-at-task doesn't work
	* You cannot trigger a handler in an imported task file from the main task file
* Best practice: store task files in a dedicated directory to make management easier 

When to Include Task Files:
* When modularity is required, for instance to differentiate between groups of tasks that need to be executed against specific host types
* When different groups of IT staff are responsible for different setup tasks 
* If a task needs to be executed only in specific cases

Using Variables for External Plays and Tasks:
* In the design, it is recommended to keep include files as generic as possible 
* Define variables independently from the playbook
	* in separate include files
	* using group_vars and host_vars
	* or using local facts
* This allows you to process different values on different groups of hosts, while still using the same playbook


vim includes.yml
vim install-and-setup.yml
ansible-playbook includes.yml
