9.1 Understanding RHEL System Roles

* RHEL system roles are provided to configure standard RHEL operations 
* RHEL system roles have been provided since RHEL 7.4, and can be used to configure RHEL 6.10 and later
* Install the rhel-system-roles package to use them
* RHEL system roles are derived from the Ansible Linux System Roles project, which is avaliable through Ansible Galaxy

Current RHEL System Roles:
* Currently, the following RHEL system roles are provided:
      * rhel-system-roles.kdump configurates the kdump crash recovery service 
      * rhel-system-roles.network configurates network interfaces
      * rhel-system-roles.selinux manages all aspects of SELinux
      * rhel-system-roles.timesync is used to set up Network Time Protocol or Precision Time Protocol
      * rhel-system-roles.postfix is used to configurate a host as a Postfix MTA
      * rhel-system-roles.firewall configurates a firewall
      * rhel-system-roles.tuned configurates the tuned service 
* Addiotional RHEL system roles are likely to be introduced

9.2 Installing RHEL System Roles

* Use: yum install rhel-system-roles to install them 
* The roles are installed to the /usr/share/ansible/roles directory, notice that the upstream linux-system-roles name is provided 
  as a symbolic link to provide maximum compatibility
* Documentation of Ansible system roles is avaliable in /usr/share/doc/rhel-system-roles-<version>
* Look for example YAML files in the role directories


su -
yum search rhel-system-roles
yum install -y rhel-system-roles
rpm -ql rhel-system-roles
cd /usr/share/ansible/roles
ls
cd rhel-system-roles.selinux/
ls
tree

9.3 Using the RHEL SELinux System Role

The RHEL system role for SELinux can do several things:
* Set enforcing or permissive mode
* Set SELinux file contexts 
* Run restorecon

Rebooting After Making Changes:
* In some cases, to apply SELinux changes (such as a switch between enabled and disabled mode), a reboot is required
* The SELinux role doesn't reboot hosts itself because it should be up to the administrator to do that
* The role will set the selinux_reboot_required variable to true, and fail if a reboot is required
* This is used in a block / rescue structure, where the play is failing if the variable is not set to true 
* If the variable is set to true, the host is rebooted and the role is started again 
* See sample code in example-selinux-playbook in the roles documentation

Setting SELinux Related Variables:
* To Configure SELinux from the role, set at least the following variables:
	* selinux_state
	* selinux_booleans
	* selinux_fcontexts
	* selinux_restore_dirs
	* selinux_ports
	
	
cd /usr/share/doc/rhel-system-roles/selinux
ls
less README.md
vim example-selinux-playbook.yml
cd /usr/share/ansible/
ls
cd roles
ls
cd rhel-system-roles.selinux/
tree
vim tasks/main.yml

9.4 Using the RHEL TimeSync System Role 

Why Does it Make Sense?
* rhel-system-roles.timesync can be used to manage time synchronization
* As the timesync service is different between RHEL 6 and RHEL 7/8, it makes sense managing this functionality using a rhel-system-role

Using rhel-system-roles.timesync:
* The role itself is configured to work with different variables, of which timesync_ntp_servers is the most important one
* Items in this variable are made up of different attributes, of which two are common:
	* hostname: shows the hostname of the time server
	* iburst: specifies that fast iburst synchronization should be used
* The timezone variable is also important, and sets the current timezone to be used
* A default playbook is avaliable in /usr/share/doc/rhel-system-roles/timesync


vim /usr/share/doc/rhel-system-roles/timesync
vim /usr/share/doc/rhel-system-roles/timesync/example-timesync-playbook.yml
vim setuptime.yml
vim setuptime-light.yml
vim group_vars/servers/timesync.yml
vim inventory
ansible-playbook setupline-light.yml
